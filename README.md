  + Small amounts of un-Structured data.

+ Ask questions in natural language.

+ Retain conversation history to continue older conversations.

+ FastAPI endpoints available to connect to UI of your choice.

+ Track LLM API calls (token counts)

+ Connect Local Models (via. OpenAI compatible endpoints)

+ No external frameworks, like langchain, llama-index etc. needed

+ More...

## Future
